                <section>
                    <p>Both deceptively easy and difficult, this Julia Childs approved meal works as a crowd pleaser and a confidence booster in the kitchen. The beauty in this dish lies in the braising of the chicken after its been soaked in a red wine with aromatics overnight. It's a meal that works in all seasons and the payoff is worth the time in locating the ingrdients. This dish is an excellent introduction into the world of involved home cooking. Bon apetit!</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Like many other french stews and stews in general, it tastes even better the next day</li>
                            <li>You get to say something french and sound like you grew up in Burgundy</li>
                            <li>Did I mention it was delicious?</li>

            <section>
                <p>Pasta pomodoro may come with a different tag associated with it depending on the restaurant but there's no denying the beauty in the simplicity of this dish. It contains all the hallmarks of a feel good meal. What separates this from the Ragu afficionados is the homemade sauce from a can of whole pomodoro tomatoes. There's a bit more work involved than struggling with a jar lid but once you make a sauce yourself I promise you will never go back.</p>

                        <li>With a hearty amount of cheese and butter we're definitely not calling this one for diet night</li>
                        <li>Who doesn't like pasta? No, seriously, who?</li>

                <img id="artimg" src="images/brinedasianporkchop.jpg" alt="brined pork chop">

                <section>
                    <p>This is a recipe I whipped up on my own using easy to find ingredients. The star of the show is the pork chop, which uses a semi-basic brine to achieve maximum tenderness and a guaranteed moist chop. After that use a white rice for color contrast, chopped scallion or green onion for aromatics and crunch, glaze with any asian sauce and top with toasted sesame seeds. Looks good, tastes great, and if you plate it correctly you can tell someone you watched a YouTube video on how to be a fancy adult.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brining is like tenderizing your meat with the ocean with less chance of a sunburn</li>
                            <li>You can use a teriyaki marinade or whip up your own goyunchang sauce so the possibilities are endless</li>
                            <li>Pro tip: slice the fat around the pork chop to promote even cooking and so the chop doesn't curl up in the pan</li>
                        </ul>
